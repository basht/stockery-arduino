Stockery ~ Arduino
==================

Small Arduino sketch that reads the portfolio of a user from his/her [Stockery](http://stockery-arduino.herokuapp.com/) account.
Uses the WiFly Shield and WiFly library, and the aJson library to parse the result.

Then - according to the status of your stock portfolio - flashes a green LED (inc of min 1%), yellow LED (status quo or inc < 1%) or red LED (dec), 
and an LCD ticker with your stocks.

Hardware
--------

To imitate the whole setup you will need an Arduino board, a WiFly Shield and a standard Hitachi HD44780 compatible LCD display. Schemes will be added later.

Software
--------

-- coming soon
